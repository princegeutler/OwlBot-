## Setting Up Environment Variables

To run Owl Bot locally, you'll need to set up a `.env` file with your environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` File**:

   - In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.

2. **Add Your Token**:

   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line:
     ```
     TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```
   - Replace `your_token_here` with the actual token you've obtained for your application.

3. **Save the File**:
   - Save the changes to the `.env` file.
